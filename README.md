Since the bddatabase.net folks aren't interested in sharing we'll get the data the slightly harder way..  

Requirements:

python 2.7+   

3 would work with some minor modifications, namely the print calls.

selenium

nodejs

phantomjs/chromedriver/firefoxdriver


I use the chromedriver so I've also included the .CRX for ublock origin since its a pain to get and bddatabase.net is full of ads and scumware.


Right now it's just outputting a json blob of the weapons category but easily modified to do more.


Enjoy :)
